This is wgrib v1.8.1.2s (8-11) compiled using cygwin_x64.

This should be compatible with 64-bit versions of Windows Vista and later.
To use, copy all the *.dll and wgrib.exe files to a directory that is on your
windows PATH.  Run wgrib from a shell such as the cygwin bash
or the windows command prompt.  On windows 10, click on the bottom 
left window icon, scroll to "Windows System" and click on it, and 
finally click on "Command prompt".  Do not click on the wgrib icon.  
The wgrib program was designed to run from a shell and is not a GUI program.
